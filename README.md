What is Crystal Bitoreum?

Crystal Bitoreum is a complete fork of the original Bitoreum project. With last official communication from the projects leader and lead developer in 5/3/2023, and his last known whereabouts being near the Russian-Ukraine conflict zone I have feared the worst. Bitoreum had a robust user-base and I do not want to see this project fall into neglect. As such I have taken the project and will continue to maintain, develop and fix the project as we move forward.

We intend to keep the token $BTRM the same and patch some of the known issues that were prevalent with the core in 2023. Once that has been achieved we intend to use the dev fee from the project (not the original fee as that is lost to the address holder, just the fee collected post fork), to seek a larger team so that if I happen to disappear the project can continue on if that is the choice of the surviving team and community around it.

I have been aware of the drama surrounding this projects formation, but that ends effective immediately. I wish to help those in the community that rode this out and work in partnership with other projects, exchanges and the larger crypto-community at large.

Bitoreum is a decentralized financial technology accessible to everyone that is fast, reliable and secure with negligible transaction costs. Bitoreum has its own blockchain, which is a fork of Raptoreum codebase with ASIC resistant POW algorithm and consensus ensuring Smartnodes which make the network immune to 51% attacks. Bitoreum coins can be mined on both CPU and GPU. Bitoreum cares about privacy and has an integrated CoinJoin mechanism that allows to hide the balance directly in the wallet.

Problems Bitoreum attempts to solve

Bitoreum is a transparent and scaleable financial system that aims to make cryptocurrencies accessible to everyone. There are four main directions in which we want to contribute.
Make managing BTRM easy for everyone by deploying mobile wallets for the major mobile OS, such as Android and IOS.

Promote the adoption of cryptocurrencies by offering a payment gateway service. The service will provide a free plugin for small businesses to facilitate online transactions in cryptocurrency. Customers will be able to pay for goods and services in $BTRM, while an entrepreneur will receive fiat money to his/her credit card.
We think that all cryptocurrencies deserve to have access to the investors and to be trade able at an exchange. To achieve this goal we want to remove entry barriers in the form of high exchange listing fees and to offer everyone Bitroeum Exchange with its own blockchain, where all coins interested in listing can be traded against Bitroeum.
We believe that everyone should be able to get a part of the financial pie with high returns that is usually accessible only to rich investors. That is why everyone can earn coins with modest initial investment by deploying Smartnodes and contributing to the blockchain stability and security.

Some notes about how we move forward. Bitoreum existed as a ‘no pre-mine’ coin, as we do not intend to change the token we cannot in good faith make this claim as a fair amount of $BTRM already exists, we understand this may be off-putting to new adopters, but this is an an effort of full transparency. 

The immediate goals are to get the new core software working, and fix the know issues. Once that is complete we wish to get the new core software to pools so there should be no need to change anything about the mining process. At the same time release the new version to the general public and move the existing smartnode owners over to the new core.

This is easy to write, but does present a real world challenge, I am one person, with the help of friends to get it off the ground, once that happens I go back to be a single person until the dev fee reaches an equitable amount to enlist developers. This fee will a quarterly report as to where it is going, in an effort of full transparency. Once these goals are accomplished there are many quality of life adjustments I would love to tackle but there is a mountain to climb first and the full road-map will be available at the new project’s website in due time:

Development Process The master branch is meant to be stable. Development is done in separate branches. Tags are created to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitoreum Core.

The contribution workflow is described in CONTRIBUTING.md.

Testing Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people lots of money.

Automated Testing Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run (assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: make check. Further details on running and extending unit tests can be found in /src/test/README.md.

There are also regression and integration tests, written in Python, that are run automatically on the build server. These tests can be run (if the test dependencies are installed) with: test/functional/test_runner.py

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is not straightforward.
